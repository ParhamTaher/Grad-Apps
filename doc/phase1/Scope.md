# Scope

## Learning Goals

* Learning about microservices architecture and react/express and how to link the two to create a modern web application. 
* Determining and learning from each otherâ€™s respective weaknesses and compromising to efficiently complete our assigned tasks.

### Consensus

* Since we all had our own respective weaknesses in web development, we determined the group division based both on what we wanted to learn and what we already knew.
* Every team member expressed their learning goals and weaknesses and based on that, we divided into two groups: frontend and backend. 
* Our learning goals within these groups matched.
* If someone in the group has a weakness, they would still be partly focusing (not as much) and learning that weakness in order to strengthen it.

## Application Scope

* Ticket assignment system workflow and different roles responsibilities. 
* Since a large chunk of the entire project will have less emphasis put into it, both the front-end and back-end will be heavily and equally focused on for the ticket assignment system.

### Omitted Features

* For GAPF system we intend to build a simple ticket creation, granting and attaching files with a basic minimal front end.
* For ticket system: ticket notes, will not be prioritized, thus will not be implemented. However, if there is available time towards the end of the project we will include the functionality.
